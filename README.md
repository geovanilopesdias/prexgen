# Prexgen: Problem and Exercise Generator
**Abstract**: it models structure generation of random-variables STEM problems.

## Background
As a brazilian physics teacher, it serves me as problem generator for assessments, in order to avoid cheating completely as well as infinite possible problems for student training.

Currently, it draws some different types "travel" about average speed/URM, UVRM and Conservation of Mechanical Energy.
