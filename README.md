# Kinematics Problem Generator
**Abstract**: it models generation of random kinematics problems.  

## Background
As a brazilian physics teacher, it serves me as problem generator for assessments, in order to avoid cheating completely.

Currently, it draws basic simple "travel" problems with speed, distance or time interval unknown in random values and unities. I'm designing other classical types of problems, such as section crossing (bridges, tunnels etc.), difference between voyage(r)s etc.
